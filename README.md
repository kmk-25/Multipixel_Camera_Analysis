# Multipixel_Camera_Analysis

This code lets you: 
- Calculate the fourier transform for each individual pixel of a camera data stream (recorded as arrays in an h5 file), 
- Calculate the relative phase at any given 
- Given any arbitrary map, calculate the sum of each image in the camera datastream multiplied by that map
- Calculate the psd of a datastream of a single value
